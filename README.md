# Motorcycle Mania

An online 'catalog' of motorcycles.

This is an example project in static html, css and js. The goal is to exercise
HTML and CSS, file paths, and the fundamentals of static web sites. It's also
foundation for illustrating the need for server-side html generation, aka
"dynamic web pages."

After checking out, run `npm install` to install dependencies. Your .gitignore
is configured to omit checking in the `node_modules` directory on purpose as that
is not your code but imported libraries.
